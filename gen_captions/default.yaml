# Caption Generation Prompts
# Customize these to change caption style and format
caption:
  # Required token - all captions must include this or they're rejected
  required_token: "[trigger]"

  # System prompt: Sets the LLM's role and behavior
  system_prompt: "You are an expert at generating detailed and accurate stability diffusion type prompts. You emphasize photo realism and accuracy in your captions."

  # User prompt: Instructions for each image
  user_prompt: "Describe the content of this image as a detailed and accurate caption for a stable diffusion model prompt and begin the response with one of two opening lines based on the gender of the person in the image. The caption should be short, concise and accurate, and should not contain any information not immediately descriptive of the image. Avoid all words with single quotes, double quotes, or any other special characters.\n\nIf the person is woman, start the response with:\n[trigger], a woman,\n\nIf the person is a man, start the response with:\n[trigger], a man,"
